# Start kube-shell

## Introduction

Once you start using Kubernetes you quickly discover your favourite command line tools.

But, today, you've got a loaner laptop (MacOS) with none of that is installed, but it does have Docker.

## Prerequisites

- A local machine with Docker installed - MacOS/Windows users can go [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for instructions.

# Steps

From the directory hosting your `git clone` of this repo, perform the following steps.
```
# Linux/MacOS
cd ./demos/
./kube-shell.sh

# Windows (untested)
...
```

Upon success the following command line prompt will appear.
```
k8sh $
```
